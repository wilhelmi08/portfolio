                <h2 class="nocenter">Purpose</h2>
                <p class="nocenter text">The game was a project in school, with the purpose of learning the Godot game engine, as well as what 2D game making is like.</p>
                <h2 class="nocenter">The Game</h2>
                <p class="nocenter text">In my game you have to complete stages while taking a dog with you. You can transport the dog by picking it up, but you cannot jump on walls or climb ladders with it ontop, so you have to find other ways around.</p>
                <p class="nocenter text">Currently there's just a tutorial level in my game and no sound.</p>
